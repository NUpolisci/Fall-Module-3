# For the purpose of this course, I am providing a shortened, 
# relatively more cleaned up version of the ANES. Therefore
# this does not resemble what you may get if you download 
# direcly from the ANES website. I am happy to shre the cleaning
# code if needed but for the purposes of the goals of this
# module, I did not want you to be bogged down by the mechanics
# of the cleaning process. 

# Put the data and this code in the SAME folder in your 
# desktop. Open this script from that folder.
# If that does not work, you many need to change the file 
# path to suit your needs

ANES <- read.csv("anes2020.csv")
